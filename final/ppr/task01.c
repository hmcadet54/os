explanation:
1. *Mutex and Condition Variables:* We use these to synchronize access to shared resources (the number of guests in each area) and to control the flow of execution so that teams act only when guests arrive in their respective areas.

2. *Guest Arrival Simulation:* This function randomly simulates guests arriving in different areas, which triggers the appropriate team to act. Each area is simulated by incrementing a counter and signaling the respective team's condition variable.

3. *Team Functions:* Each function waits for its condition to be signaled before acting. Once signaled, they report the action taken (e.g., serving refreshments, starting a coding challenge) and reset the guest count for their area to zero, simulating that the guests have been served.

4. *Thread Creation and Management:* Threads are created for each team and joined back in the main function. This ensures that the program does not terminate prematurely, allowing each team to process all guest arrivals.

### Additional Considerations:
- *Error Checking:* This code omits error checking for brevity. In a real-world application, you would want to check the return values of functions like pthread_create, pthread_mutex_lock, and pthread_cond_wait for errors.
- *Randomness:* The use of rand() is simplistic. For more realistic simulations, consider seeding the random number generator with srand(time(NULL)) at the beginning of your program, or use more sophisticated random number generation methods.
- *Thread Safety:* Make sure that all access to shared resources is properly protected with mutexes to prevent race conditions.
- *Scalability:* This model can be scaled up with more teams and locations by adding more threads and condition variables, adjusting the logic as necessary to fit the expanded scope.

This comprehensive setup should provide a robust foundation for your exam question, demonstrating an understanding of thread synchronization with Pthreads in a practicalÂ scenario.
